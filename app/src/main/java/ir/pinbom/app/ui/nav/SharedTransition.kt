 *  PinBom · shared pin transition
 *  A pin tile in any wall and the hero on the pin screen are the same object, so
 *  they share bounds: the tile's bounds animate into the hero's on the way in,
 *  and back on the way out. The scopes travel per route through a composition
 *  local, which keeps every screen signature unchanged — a surface that never
 *  publishes a scope (search results, previews) simply gets its modifier back.
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */

 * The tile → hero morph is switched off by default. It needs the whole app inside
 * a `SharedTransitionLayout` (a lookahead pass over every layout, scrolling walls
 * included) and a `sharedBounds` node on every tile; that costs frames on every
 * scroll and every tab switch, for one animation. Flip to `true` to bring it back.
